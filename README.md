I hope you are well. see i want a website that does the following thing, first update the height automatically in the website  when the patient is stood before kinect v2(A camera), then  manually enter age, gender, name, then creates a unique id like M20HE like male, age is 20 and first 2 letters is HE, and if the same patient comes again, should notify that patient already exists.., then once height thing is done, then there would be a button, start skeletal  tracking! then it should send the skeletal data in the same patient ID  for every second,  then there would be a button for stop skeletal tracking. that is it!

let me share the video clip with you what exactly is the problem.
1. Height is always 1.56, if needed algo for height calculation, ready to provide
2. when I press start skeletal capture, that is getting failed..
3.  The working should be after height updation, when we press start skeletal capture, it should store all the node data for every second as the patient walks at that time, and should stop when skeletal tracking is clicked which is not happening! 

4. When the skeletal tracking is started, it should be stored in that particular ID only not in temp_patient and until  pressed stop skeletal tracking, for every second it should send the data to firebase!
